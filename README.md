# Cycloconverter-with-Voltage-control
<p>
A cycloconverter is a power electronics device that converts AC power at one frequency to AC power at another frequency, typically lower, without an intermediate DC link. Cycloconverters can be classified as step-down or step-up depending on whether the output frequency is lower or higher than the input frequency.

Cycloconverters with voltage control are used to control the output voltage of the converter. Voltage control is achieved by adjusting the firing angles of the thyristors in the converter. By changing the firing angle, the waveform of the output voltage can be altered to achieve the desired output voltage.

  There are two types of cycloconverters with voltage control:

1. Single-phase to single-phase cycloconverters: This type of cycloconverter is used to control the output voltage of a single-phase load. The output voltage waveform      can be modified by adjusting the firing angle of the thyristors in the converter.

2. Three-phase to single-phase cycloconverters: This type of cycloconverter is used to control the output voltage of a three-phase load. The output voltage waveform can    be modified by adjusting the firing angles of the thyristors in the converter.
